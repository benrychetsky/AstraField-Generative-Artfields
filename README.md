# AstraField - Generative Artfields

🌌 AstraField

AstraField is a generative art tool powered by a Python FastAPI backend and a React frontend.
Inspired by abstract album art (like Hello Meteor), AstraField creates dynamic, geometry- and photo-driven artworks with gradients, halftones, grids, and layered effects.

🚀 Features

🎨 Generative backdrops — gradients, grids, geometric primitives, halftone patterns.

🖼️ Photo integration — upload a mountain, ocean, or forest photo as a base layer.

⚙️ Adjustable parameters — tweak grid density, dot size, palettes, and randomness.

📼 Retro texture — film grain + vignette for a print-inspired aesthetic.

⚡ Modern frontend — React UI with live preview, sliders, and “Generate/Download” buttons.
